=============

# Announcement: The generator part of this product has been included in the [main stream](https://github.com/vim/vim) with [9b53c05](https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/9b53c052d58f73f2078c61a74622687306e51c17).
# This product will no longer be updated.

## Difference between [original][original]

-   The syntax-vim-ex has been generated by parse the C source code of Vim.  So
    keyword extraction is accurate.
-   Omitted keyword extraction algorithm of Ex command is perfect because it is
    same and the C source code of Vim.
-   It will immediately follow the Vim updates.
-   Generator source code is all open sourced.  (See [generator][generator] branch)

## Requirement

Vim 7.4.1486 or later

## How to Install

```sh
$ cd ~/.vim
$ mkdir -p pack/my/opt
$ cd pack/my/opt
$ git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/vim-jp/syntax-vim-ex.git
```

Add following line to your `.vimrc`.

```vim
packadd! syntax-vim-ex
```

**Remarks:**

-   In the case of Windows should read the `~/.vim` to
    `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\vimfiles`.  And mkdir `-p` option is not required.
-   Directory name `my` can be changed to any name.
-   If you want to configure the package under `~/.vim` directory as in this
    example the setting of option `'packpath'` is not required.
-   If you are calling `:packloadall` explicitly in your .vimrc, `packadd`
    should be added before it.

$ cd ~/.vim/pack/my/opt/syntax-vim-ex
